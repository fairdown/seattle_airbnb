<h3>Installation</h3>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python. The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

<h3>Project Motivation</h3>

For this project, I was interestested in using Seattle Airbnb Open Data that Udacity provides me:

I was looking for 4 questions:

<ol>
<li>Which months are most rented?</li>
<li>Do they prefer houses in a certain neighborhood in Seattle?</li>
<li>How many good and bad reviews exists?</li>
<li>What are the reasons they like or dislike their stays?</li>
</ol>

<h3>File Descriptions</h3>

There are 4 notebooks available here to showcase work related to the above questions. Each of the notebooks is exploratory in searching through the data pertaining to the questions showcased by the notebook title. Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.

<h3>Results</h3>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available here.

<h3>Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements</h3>

Must give credit to Airbnb and Kaggle for the data. You can find the Licensing for the data and other descriptive information at the Kaggle link available <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/seattle/data">here</a>.
