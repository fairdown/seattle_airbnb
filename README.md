<h3>Project Motivation</h3>

For this project, I was looking for the experiences of people who used Airbnb, if they liked more than unliked, if they had some preferences houses in certain neighbourhood, because I have never tried using Airbnb.

I was looking for 4 questions:

<ol>
<li>Which months are most rented?</li>
<li>Do they prefer houses in a certain neighborhood in Seattle?</li>
<li>How many good and bad reviews exists?</li>
<li>What are the reasons they like or dislike their stays?</li>
</ol>

<h3>File Descriptions</h3>

There are 4 notebooks available here to showcase work related to the above questions. Each of the notebooks is exploratory in searching through the data pertaining to the questions showcased by the notebook title. Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.
