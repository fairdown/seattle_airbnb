       "84842  We loved how close it was to the Convention Center and it was very convenient for the two of us attending our conference right next door.  Doug was great and accommodating, being flexible with me on our arrival and departure times. He even helped me with my luggage from the parking garage. We had everything we needed and loved hanging out on the rooftop deck to watch the solar eclipse.  If there is any room for improvement, I would recommend outlining the arrival procedure a little better upfront, especially regarding getting to the parking space, to prevent any confusion. Also, some updates to the bathroom would be very nice since it is on the smaller side. Overall, we were pleased with our stay and had a great experience.  \n",

       "84844                                     The description and pictures of the apartment were exactly what we received. Moreover, the place was very nice and we really enjoyed our stay! The location was perfect for being near to the conference center. In addition, we stayed during a weird stretch of weather (sometimes hot, sometimes cold), and they were very accommodating by providing both extra heating and cooling units. Check-in was smooth and thorough. We appreciated receiving 6 sets of keys, since we had 4 adults staying in the same place. Also, we forgot to return one of the parking fobs when we checked out, and they let us return it late without an issue. All together, a very enjoyable experience and we would stay here again!  \n",

It's only ten minutes' walk over the bridge into the University district from here, where you can find great museums and tap into a bus network  going all over Seattle; plus you can get a bus from right by Maggie's to Capitol Hill. \\r\\nThere are some lovely cafes within walking distance and a nearby rowing club from which scullers take to the water at 6am....</td>\n",

       "42431  Maggie's home was an absolute find for my stay in Seattle and I would love to return some day. My month on the water felt incredibly restorative, almost like a retreat, and Maggie is a gracious, thoughtful and welcoming host. \\r\\nThe bedroom is comfortable and roomy and the bathroom  charming, as is the whole houseboat. There is nothing to match the views of the water at all hours of day and night, rain or shine, with its passing boats and waterfowl. \\r\\nI liked the fact that you can sometimes hear the hum of traffic from University Bridge, as this juxtaposition of tranquil water and busy urban highways is so typical of the city. It's only ten minutes' walk over the bridge into the University district from here, where you can find great museums and tap into a bus network  going all over Seattle; plus you can get a bus from right by Maggie's to Capitol Hill. \\r\\nThere are some lovely cafes within walking distance and a nearby rowing club from which scullers take to the water at 6am....  \n",

The idea of being closer to nature while in the big city was appealing.  The rowing teams glided by early each morning rain or mist or shine.   Maggie is a gracious host who shared her experiences on a floating home through the seasons and gave us tips for local eateries.  The neighborhood is quiet and respectful with a french bakery and other restaurants nearby.  Even though parking is a few blocks away, we had no trouble finding a spot and the neighborhood felt safe.  After living in the northwest 15 years, we finally felt like we truly got to experience a fine slice of Seattle.  \n",

There was such a sense of peace in this place, both in the home and the about the hostess. I have never stayed in a floating home before and I loved being right on the water. Literally. Watching the sunrise and sunset and the sailboats passing was beautiful. I slept so well with the peacefulness and gently movement from the water. It was truly the retreat of rest I was seeking. I went home completely refreshed. The home was very clean and just as described in the listing, I was very comfortable. I really enjoyed the neighborhoods and all they had to offer, so much was within walking distance or a quick Uberx ride. The hostess was delightful and respectful and I am so grateful for my time there. I am looking forward to visiting again!  \n",

I stayed there for a week and a half and it was perfect for that amount of time. The kitchen was huge and had everything I needed. The room itself and the shared bathroom were big and clean as well. For a house with that many people, it was surprisingly quiet. The location was very convenient, only a block and a half to the bus stop to go downtown where I was working. Central Ballard and Green Lake park were easily accessible too. The neighborhood was cute, with a pocket of a few restaurants only a block or so away. Overall I had a really good experience.  \n",

Our hosts were very hospitable and contact was easy. I definitely hope to stay here again.   \n",

Kt's hospitality is genuine and sweet, this place was all about the details, from the fresh eggs laid by the \"Marks\" (pet chickens), to the unique japanese soak tub; there was truly perfect architectural economy for a little space mixed with some local Seattle hospitality. Do not be fooled by the pull out bed, it was amazingly comfortable. The location is also a plus, there were many restaurants in the neighborhood, and a local distillery owned by none other than are wonderful hosts. Who if I may say so create an amazing gin! This place is simply a gem and epitomizes an airbnb experience perfectly.  \n",

       "42457  My husband and I live on one of Puget Sound's islands and needed a place to stay after an event in the city. Kt's place was a 5 star solution on all counts. She accommodated our late arrival and super early departure without issue. The apartment has been constructed with a beautiful combination new and old materials which complement the main house.  If you are skeptical about the sofa bed comfort you can put your mind at ease... we are both over 6 feet tall and we slept like babes. The soaking tub in the bathroom is gorgeous and a luxurious soak should not be missed. Nice touches like chocolate treats on arrival and morning bagels, eggs and coffee were much appreciated.  The neighborhood is one of the most happening in Seattle.  This was our hood about a decade ago and the development has been astounding, all for the better. The house is on a quiet, leafy street yet steps away from a trendy, urban scene with the best new pubs and restaurants in town. We will def keep this gem in mi...  \n",

We had previously stayed in a hotel in Belltown, and we preferred the location and atmosphere of this apartment.  The apartment was very cozy and had everything we needed. The pullout bed was very comfortable, and definitely more comfortable than the beds at the economy hotel we stayed at before.  The kitchen had everything we needed for a quick breakfast and the fresh chicken eggs were a special treat.  The soaking tub was divine.  But best of all was the location; there were tons of great bars, restaurants, and shops just a few short blocks away.  We also loved being able to walk everywhere and a pleasant walk to pike place market took about 20 minutes.  Kt made everything smooth and easy and I highly recommend this apartment.   "

Melissa was a very easy host to work with - she allowed us to check in early and was very responsive when we had questions throughout our stay. The one major issue with the apartment that we were not expecting was just outside - when we walked in on the first day, we peeked out the kitchen window into an alley (fine) that was apparently a hot spot for drug use (not fine). Throughout our entire stay, every time we looked out the window people were in the alley partaking in some very hardcore using. It was very unsettling to know that was so close to us and while no one ever bothered us in the neighborhood, it was a major concern.

The management company, Pillow, is pretty incompetent. I had problems getting my key (the instructions were vague). I called them twice, waiting 15 rings (!) before someone picked up. That person then just repeated the same vague instructions. Unhelpful. \\r\\n3. THEY WANTED TO CHARGE ME $25 FOR AN EXTRA PILLOW. And wouldn't give extra blankets. The house is *huge*.

       "4203   The apartment itself was totally fine - about what we expected, based on the photos and description. The space was a great size for 2 people and it was nice to have the kitchenette as an option while visiting Seattle. Melissa was a very easy host to work with - she allowed us to check in early and was very responsive when we had questions throughout our stay. The one major issue with the apartment that we were not expecting was just outside - when we walked in on the first day, we peeked out the kitchen window into an alley (fine) that was apparently a hot spot for drug use (not fine). Throughout our entire stay, every time we looked out the window people were in the alley partaking in some very hardcore using. It was very unsettling to know that was so close to us and while no one ever bothered us in the neighborhood, it was a major concern. Again, the apartment itself was great and exactly what we were looking for, but my fiance and I agreed the alley view was something that need...  \n",

The WIFI didn't work properly twice during my stay, and Melissa was very helpful in solving the problems. I will recommend it to those who are seeking a room with an inexpensive rent and a compatible quality.   \n",
       "80851  A beautiful, clean house in a convenient location marred by a bad management company. \\r\\n\\r\\nI love AirBnB to death, but this may be the first negative AirBnB review I leave after ... 100+ stays. Which is unfortunate. \\r\\n\\r\\nHere's a list of issues:\\r\\n1. I never spoke with the owners. The house is run by Pillow, a management co. This is a critical part of the AirBnB experience to me -- knowing who you're dealing with and getting their perspective on the community. Also, only the owners know how the house is set up. \\r\\n2. The management company, Pillow, is pretty incompetent. I had problems getting my key (the instructions were vague). I called them twice, waiting 15 rings (!) before someone picked up. That person then just repeated the same vague instructions. Unhelpful. \\r\\n3. THEY WANTED TO CHARGE ME $25 FOR AN EXTRA PILLOW. And wouldn't give extra blankets. The house is *huge*. Surely there's an extra pillow somewhere? But all the cabinets were locked.  Because of bad pillow...  \n",

She must work 24 hours a day because she was so often available. This was one of their first times renting for airbnb and our experience with the actual place wasn't great. This location is best for those not traveling with a car and who want to explore all that Seattle has to offer. The location is amazing, just a few blocks from Pike Place Market and the Symphony, one block from the light rail station, kitty corner from the art museum, etc. The place is great esp if you plant to spend most of your time out in the city. Note: There is no AC for the summer time and even with the fan provided it was very uncomfortable.   \n",
