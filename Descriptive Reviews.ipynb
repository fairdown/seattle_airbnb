       "84842  We loved how close it was to the Convention Center and it was very convenient for the two of us attending our conference right next door.  Doug was great and accommodating, being flexible with me on our arrival and departure times. He even helped me with my luggage from the parking garage. We had everything we needed and loved hanging out on the rooftop deck to watch the solar eclipse.  If there is any room for improvement, I would recommend outlining the arrival procedure a little better upfront, especially regarding getting to the parking space, to prevent any confusion. Also, some updates to the bathroom would be very nice since it is on the smaller side. Overall, we were pleased with our stay and had a great experience.  \n",

No complaints on our end, we truly were spoiled here. We even got to see the nice veiw from the roof! All in all a great trip of seeing Seattle, we would definitely book a trip again!  \n",
       "84844                                     The description and pictures of the apartment were exactly what we received. Moreover, the place was very nice and we really enjoyed our stay! The location was perfect for being near to the conference center. In addition, we stayed during a weird stretch of weather (sometimes hot, sometimes cold), and they were very accommodating by providing both extra heating and cooling units. Check-in was smooth and thorough. We appreciated receiving 6 sets of keys, since we had 4 adults staying in the same place. Also, we forgot to return one of the parking fobs when we checked out, and they let us return it late without an issue. All together, a very enjoyable experience and we would stay here again!  \n",

Kt's hospitality is genuine and sweet, this place was all about the details, from the fresh eggs laid by the \"Marks\" (pet chickens), to the unique japanese soak tub; there was truly perfect architectural economy for a little space mixed with some local Seattle hospitality. Do not be fooled by the pull out bed, it was amazingly comfortable. The location is also a plus, there were many restaurants in the neighborhood, and a local distillery owned by none other than are wonderful hosts. Who if I may say so create an amazing gin! This place is simply a gem and epitomizes an airbnb experience perfectly.</td>\n",

If you are skeptical about the sofa bed comfort you can put your mind at ease... we are both over 6 feet tall and we slept like babes. The soaking tub in the bathroom is gorgeous and a luxurious soak should not be missed. Nice touches like chocolate treats on arrival and morning bagels, eggs and coffee were much appreciated.  The neighborhood is one of the most happening in Seattle.  This was our hood about a decade ago and the development has been astounding, all for the better. The house is on a quiet, leafy street yet steps away from a trendy, urban scene with the best new pubs and restaurants in town. We will def keep this gem in mi...</td>\n",

The pullout bed was very comfortable, and definitely more comfortable than the beds at the economy hotel we stayed at before.  The kitchen had everything we needed for a quick breakfast and the fresh chicken eggs were a special treat.  The soaking tub was divine.  But best of all was the location; there were tons of great bars, restaurants, and shops just a few short blocks away.  We also loved being able to walk everywhere and a pleasant walk to pike place market took about 20 minutes.  Kt made everything smooth and easy and I highly recommend this apartment.</td>\n",

She had everything labeled and organized in her b n b, and shared lots of valuable information about the area.  I knew exactly where things belonged and the best most respectful way to cohabitate and respect other renters privacy and space. Very clean and very comfortable. Her bike borrowing system was invaluable for commuting to town for yoga, food and parks. Pikes place was just a 40 minute pleasant bike ride away. Ballard is a nice, safe neighborhood. Loved it!  \n",

       "42443  This place is a true gem.

       "42445  This is a lovely little place, bursting with character and charm. I suppose the word \"rustic\" does apply - everything is small, and oldish but things are well kept up and/or nicely refurbished, and the place is thoughtfully arranged to make the best use of the space. The kitchen is little but stocked with all the basics & easy to find things in, the bathroom looks a little unusual but is great to use - great showerhead, & we were so sad we didn't have time to try the amazing-looking soaker tub. The bed is a fold-out, but one of the more comfortable fold-outs I've ever encountered. It's not super soft, but there are no uncomfortable bars or dips or anything. If you have back problems though, or can only sleep on very soft beds, then this may not be the place for you.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe hosts seemed lovely (didn't get to meet them in person but communicated with them a bunch), and left us fresh eggs and cream and bagels in the fridge, which was just what we needed when we had to rush off ear...  \n",

       "42448  Staying here was wonderful! Past reviews are correct in saying that the photos really don't do this place justice - the place was even better than we'd expected: clean and decorated impeccably!  The soaking tub was beyond awesome - all I want is one in my own house now!  And they were right: the pull out bed was surprisingly actually super comfortable (& this is coming from someone who hates sleeping on pull out couches where bars press against your back all night!).  The place is also very conveniently located - we were able to leave our car at the apt (free parking!) and walked down to the trendy Capitol Heights area for dinner & drinks. \\r\\n\\r\\nKt was also immensely kind and accommodating.  She worked around our schedule for both check-in and check-out (extending our check-out time as we needed), and was very hospitable (a yummy chocolate bar left w our check-in note, farm-fresh eggs from the chickens outside left for us for breakfast along w bagels and coffee, etc.)  \\r\\n\\r\\nI ...  \n",
       "42449  KT and Kirby were stellar hosts! The tiny little apartment is cozy and everything has been nicely renovated with a mix of modern and antique finishes. We had fresh eggs from their chickens every morning, which was a lovely touch. The bathroom with the Japanese soaking tub is awesome and feels like a spa. Also, the place is ideally located near some great bars and restaurants--even in the cold November rain, we had no problem walking to everywhere we wanted to go. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe only potential negative is also a positive because of how well they handled the situation. After the first night, my boyfriend and I decided that the pullout couch bed was just too hard to sleep on. After texting KT about it, she immediately apologized and offered to pick up a foam topper from Bed, Bath, and Beyond, and if that didn't work, she was going to help us find another place that better suited our needs.

The tub- amazing! The bed was pretty comfortable and very easy to set up. Every light has a dimmer on it so that you can have that nice low-key candlelit feel without the safety hazard. And I assure you there are enough outlets to recharge everything you brought with you, in fact I don't think you can stand anywhere in the place and not be within 3-4 feet of an outlet, with the exception of the tub. Our hosts were very hospitable and contact was easy. I definitely hope to stay here again.   \n",

Kt's hospitality is genuine and sweet, this place was all about the details, from the fresh eggs laid by the \"Marks\" (pet chickens), to the unique japanese soak tub; there was truly perfect architectural economy for a little space mixed with some local Seattle hospitality. Do not be fooled by the pull out bed, it was amazingly comfortable. The location is also a plus, there were many restaurants in the neighborhood, and a local distillery owned by none other than are wonderful hosts. Who if I may say so create an amazing gin! This place is simply a gem and epitomizes an airbnb experience perfectly.  \n",

       "42457  My husband and I live on one of Puget Sound's islands and needed a place to stay after an event in the city. Kt's place was a 5 star solution on all counts. She accommodated our late arrival and super early departure without issue. The apartment has been constructed with a beautiful combination new and old materials which complement the main house.  If you are skeptical about the sofa bed comfort you can put your mind at ease... we are both over 6 feet tall and we slept like babes. The soaking tub in the bathroom is gorgeous and a luxurious soak should not be missed. Nice touches like chocolate treats on arrival and morning bagels, eggs and coffee were much appreciated.  The neighborhood is one of the most happening in Seattle.  This was our hood about a decade ago and the development has been astounding, all for the better.

The home itself was quite easy to locate as was finding our parking spot. Kt also provided perfectly thorough directions, how-tos, and tips. The soaker tub was perfect, the bed was very comfortable, everything clean, and fresh eggs in the fridge lovingly provided by the Chickens-All-Named-Mark! You can tell a lot of care was/is put into the decor and maintenance of the apartment. Thanks Kt! We'd definitely stay here again, and hopefully get a chance to meet you (and your pup!)  \n",

There is a king size bed for 2 people and for a third person  a very small, tiny and narrow sofa, that is good enough to have a short nap!!!!  When I called to a property management and told that... The answer was : we can deliver a air bed for 50$ delivery fee ?!?!? Why ?!? We paid for a night 319$ US. \\r\\nThe second one, there is NO internet ! We again, called to the property managemnet and asked if there is a wireless or wired Internet ! The man on the phone said,he would call to the owner and asked for a WIFI password and log in. Never called  us back :( \\r\\nThe third, it was very cold in the appartment ! There is no an instruction or a guest info book or so... \\r\\nWe at our own risk, opened the hitter's vents and eventually it was little bit warmer! \\r\\nOne m...  \n",

       "72262  I stayed at Vivian's place since it was located in SLU, the area where I had to work for a few days. The place was clean, located in a very nice neighborhood. I didn't get the chance to meet Vivian personally, but her boyfriend and their friend welcomed me. The room was very clean and the place has a full kitchen that you could use. \\r\\n\\r\\nAt first, I was disappointed that this place doesn't have a private bathroom which was different from the listing description. I knew this after I requested to book. One night, at around midnight, it was extremely loud that I couldn't sleep since Oscar and his friend were playing xbox until like 1am with a loud shouting. I felt like I am staying at college dorm :-(  Since I had to work, I wished it was more quiet at night and they were more considerate to guests. Another thing was that I had to call someone (their friend) to enter the house each time. Hope these are things that future guests might want to know before booking, and I hope Vivian a...  \n",
